<h1 align="center">Findle – AI Smart Tag & Safety Platform</h1>
<p align="center"><i>Smarter tracking. Safer living.</i></p>

---

## Overview
Findle is a next-generation **AI-powered smart tag** that:
- **Detects theft in real time**
- **Locates hidden items**, even through walls/furniture
- Powers **life-saving personal safety automations**

We combine **hardware + subscription** - a notoriously brutal model - so from day one, we’ve engineered to:
- Scale subscriptions fast
- Use **our own logistics hubs** to reduce retail cost
- Maintain cost advantage over copycats

---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## The Brutal Truth
> Margins on hardware are tight.  
> Copycat threat is **real**.  
> Regulatory risk is **non-trivial**.  

> Even with patents, big players can close the gap fast - our moat will be:
> - **Exclusive datasets** from theft-prevention events  
> - **Relentless cost-down** at scale  
> - **Constant innovation** in theft detection & safety features

> [!NOTE]
> We’ve built **anti-stalking protocols** and will secure **US/EU legal approval** before launch - because one misuse case could derail momentum.

## Why We’re Different
- **AI Theft Detection** - ML-powered, 90% fewer false positives vs existing tags  
- **3D Precision Finding** - AR + sensor fusion for tracking through obstructions  
- **Beyond Tracking** - Roadmap to evolve into a **personal safety platform**

---

## Traction
- **1000+ Surveyed + Market Research**
- **Beta Hardware + App + Landing Page** Ready in about a week.
- **50 paying testers** in 2 days  
- **835+ waitlist members** pre-launch  
- **96% daily engagement** in paid beta  
---

## The Team
We’re all **18 years old**, but:
- Built & led prior ventures together  
- Delivered complex AI/IoT products  
- Operated in startup environments with real customers  

**Domain expertise + early-stage grit = outlier team.**

---

## Challenges Ahead
1. **Scaling distribution** cost-effectively  
2. **Maximizing subscription retention** despite hardware-heavy CAC  
3. **Defending moat** in a fast-moving, high-risk category

---

## 90-Day Targets
- **Provisional patents** filed (hardware + ML methodology)  
- **100+ verified theft-prevention events** (raw/audited data)  
- **Cost-down proof** for 100k-unit margins  
- **Churn model** backed by beta retention data  
- **Regulatory compliance report** (US/EU)

---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Roadmap to Moat
> Our bet: evolve from a hardware tracker to a **data-driven safety ecosystem** - unique datasets + scaled subscriptions + continuous innovation = sustainable ARR growth.
