<h1 align="center">Findle – AI Smart Tag & Safety Platform</h1>
<p align="center"><i>Smarter tracking. Safer living.</i></p>

---

## Overview
Findle is a next-generation **AI-powered smart tag** that:
- **Detects theft in real time**
- **Locates hidden items**, even through walls/furniture
- Powers **life-saving personal safety automations**

---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## The Brutal Truth
> Margins on hardware are tight.  
> Copycat threat is **real**.  
> Regulatory risk is **non-trivial**.  

> Even with patents, big players can close the gap fast - our moat will be:
> - **Exclusive hard-to-obtain datasets** from actual real-world theft-prevention events  
> - **Relentless cost-down** at scale
> - **Constant innovation** in theft detection & safety features

> We combine **hardware + subscription** - a notoriously brutal model - so from day one, we’ve engineered to:
> - Scale subscriptions fast
> - Use **our own logistics hubs** to reduce retail cost
> - Maintain cost advantage over copycats

---

> [!NOTE]
> We’ve built **anti-stalking protocols** and will secure **US/EU legal approval** before launch - because one misuse case could derail momentum.

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Perfect Timing
> Even though copycat threat is high and the big dogs wouldn't have an issue, we think this is the perfect time to take the tag industry by storm.
> The big dogs of the industry?
> - Apple: They're dropping a new AirTag soon... but it’s basically the same as the old one with a slightly better chip. Right now, all of Apple’s attention is on saving face with the iPhone (critics are putting them under fire for lack of innovation), updating the Watch, and diving deep into AR/VR. Tags? Not even in their top 10 priorities.
> - Samsung: They’re all-in on foldables, flipping phones, and shoving AI into every corner of their smartphone lineup. Their ecosystem is fragmented, and their SmartThings tags are treated as secondary accessories. Their tag offering is a sidekick at best.
> - Tile: They lost customer trust with the Tile Ultra. All smoke and mirrors. They launched the Tile Ultra, the most revolutionary smart tracker (or at least claimed), and there was huge hype and media buzz, but not even a prototype was seen. Not even one unit sold. I would crown this as one of the greats, but among vaporware.

## Why We’re Different
- **AI Theft Detection** - ML-powered, 90% fewer false positives vs existing tags  
- **3D Precision Finding** - AR + sensor fusion for tracking through obstructions  
- **Beyond Tracking** - Roadmap to evolve into a **personal safety platform**

---

## Traction
- **1000+ Surveyed + Market Research**
- **Beta Hardware + App + Landing Page** Ready in about a week.
- **50 paying testers** in 2 days  
- **835+ waitlist members** pre-launch  
- **96% daily engagement** in paid beta  
---

## The Team
We’re all **18 years old**, but:
- Built & led prior ventures together  
- Delivered complex AI/IoT products  
- Operated in startup environments with real customers  

**Domain expertise + early-stage grit = outlier team.**

---

## Challenges Ahead
1. **Scaling distribution** cost-effectively  
2. **Maximizing subscription retention** despite hardware-heavy CAC  
3. **Defending moat** in a fast-moving, high-risk category

---

## 90-Day Targets
- **Provisional patents** filed (hardware + ML methodology)  
- **100+ verified theft-prevention events** (raw/audited data)  
- **Cost-down proof** for 100k-unit margins  
- **Churn model** backed by beta retention data  
- **Regulatory compliance report** (US/EU)

---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Roadmap to Moat
> Our bet: evolve from a hardware tracker to a **data-driven safety ecosystem** - unique datasets + scaled subscriptions + continuous innovation = sustainable ARR growth.
